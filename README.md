# Churn_Analysis

Just wrapped up my third project — a churn analysis for a telecom company.
I used Python to perform exploratory data analysis and visualize key factors behind customer churn.
🔍 Key highlights:
26.5% of customers have churned.
Senior citizens and short-tenure users show higher churn.
Services like OnlineSecurity and TechSupport help reduce churn.
Electronic check as a payment method correlates with higher churn.
This was a good learning experience and helped me understand how data can reveal patterns behind customer behavior.
I’d love to hear your feedback or suggestions — especially from folks working in analytics or customer retention!
